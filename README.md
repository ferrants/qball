Super easy way to queue up processes needing locks on resources, or balls in this metaphore

You hold a ball and put it back when you're done. If you're waiting for a ball, no one else can take it. 

Running:
========
```
# Set up repo, bower install, npm install, linking
./init.sh

# Run on port 8080
coffee server.coffee

# Run on port 9090
HTTP_PORT=9090 coffee server.coffee

# Or run with docker
docker run -p 8080:8080 ferrants/qball
```

Admin:
======
Visit the base url, you will see an admin panel. You can enable auto-admin so you don't have to worry about it.
